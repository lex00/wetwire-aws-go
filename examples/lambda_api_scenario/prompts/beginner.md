I need to create a simple REST API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

Can you help me set up:
- A Lambda function that handles API requests
- An API Gateway to expose the function as a REST endpoint
- The right permissions so everything works together

I want to be able to call the API and get a response from the Lambda function.

Please create the CloudFormation resources I need.
